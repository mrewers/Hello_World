## You Don't Know JS

[You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) is a book series by Kyle Simpson that provides an in-depth explanation of the fundamental concepts underpinning JavaScript. This [repo](./You_Don't_Know_JS) contains notes and practice exercises I completed while reading the books.

_Disclaimer: To the best of my knowledge all code included in this repo is publicly available elsewhere and freely available for educational purposes. I've made an effort not to include code that would be considered private. Please support these great educators in any way you can. They put tremendous effort into these resources and the whole development community is better off because of them._
